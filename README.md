I'm a student in the Statistics for Science and Technology undergraduate program at the University of Padua
with a passion for what I study, always looking for useful insights and new opportunities.  

I'm interested in all aspects of Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning.  

Currently keeping on learning Python, R and SQL and looking to expand my skill set.
