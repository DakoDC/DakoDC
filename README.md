I'm a student at the undergraduate program of Statistics for Science and Technology at University of Padua 
with a passion for what I study while always looking for useful insights and new opportunities.  

I'm interested in all aspects of Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning.  

Currently keeping on learning Python, R and SQL and looking to expand my skillset.
